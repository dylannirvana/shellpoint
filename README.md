This is a modern HTML application rendering in PHP. It was built using Bootstrap4, ES6, SASS, Compass, ScrollMagic, jQuery with Gulp as a task runner.

The application is responsive in the Chrome console and is accessibility compliant.

To run the application, cd to builds/development and run npm install in your terminal. Please deploy it on a PHP server with Apache. See package.json for dependancies.

We are deploying the uncompressed development version because the client makes changes directly in the code.
