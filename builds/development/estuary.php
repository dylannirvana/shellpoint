            <p>Entering The Estuary at Shell Point is like taking a step back into Florida’s past. Winding streets dotted with homes depicting the vintage style of Old-Florida architecture with metal roofs, clapped siding, dormers and cupolas, and welcoming front porches.</p>

            <p>Oak trees, brick paths, and native palms will add to the charm of this neighborhood, which reflects on the area’s location near Gulf beaches, silent mangroves, and native bird sanctuaries.</p>

            <p>In the center of the neighborhood is an 4-acre lake surrounded by a meandering walking path ringed with silver buttonwood trees and native palms.</p>

            <p>To the south of the neighborhood is a vintage view of Florida’s natural beauty found in the silent mangrove haven that surrounds a secluded lake that is home to fish, otters, and turtles. On any given day, white pelicans, ospreys, mockingbirds, egrets, wood storks, bald eagles, pileated woodpeckers, and a variety of herons can be found wading the shores of the lake or perching overhead.</p>
