          <div class="col-md-8">

            <p>The Island is designed to make the most of its beautiful setting overlooking the Caloosahatchee River. Residents have choice of studio, one-, two-, or three-bedroom plans. All are maintenance-free and most have private lanais. Virtually everything you will need to lead the carefree Florida lifestyle is included in your residence at Shell Point.</p>

            <p>Imagine living so close to Sanibel that it's quicker to get there by boat than by car! And then imagine you can Dock your Boat for FREE, with the marina being just a golf cart ride to your home. For boaters who live at Shell Point, this is an advantage that no other retirement community can offer. </p>

            <p>Boaters enjoy free dockage with water, electricity, and direct deep-water access to the Caloosahatchee River, just minutes from the Gulf of Mexico. </p>

            <p>To the south of the neighborhood is a vintage view of Florida’s natural beauty found in the silent mangrove haven that surrounds a secluded lake that is home to fish, otters, and turtles. On any given day, white pelicans, ospreys, mockingbirds, egrets, wood storks, bald eagles, pileated woodpeckers, and a variety of herons can be found wading the shores of the lake or perching overhead.</p>
