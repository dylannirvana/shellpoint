                    <h2 class="script">Academy Class: Sea Turtles</h2>
                    <p>Because people fought to maintain areas of wild habitat in Southwest Florida while other areas of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts collapsed, Southwest Florida is a rarified place. It is home to many endangered and threatened species such as manatees, sawfish, and four species of sea turtles. Kristie Anders, Education Director at the Sanibel Captiva Conservation Foundation, will present an educational program that primarily focuses on the loggerhead turtle. However, attendees will also learn about the green sea turtle; the Kemp’s Ridley turtle, which spends its juvenile years in the sea grasses of Pine Island Sound; and a very rare, 700-pound leatherback that chose Sanibel’s beach for a nesting event just a few years ago. Kristie will also incorporate new information acquired from a sea turtle geneticist into her presentation. Tickets for this class cost $10,* and may be purchased by calling (239) 489-8472.</p>
